I COULD EAT A HORSE is a Scotland-wide arts project, run by A Moments's Peace Theatre Company, that aims to inspire individuals and communities to reflect upon their daily rituals and consider how these sit within a broader context of food production, accessibility and consumption.

Gareth worked as the sound artist on 3 projects, taking sound recordings and composing scores for the final films.

The Acoustic Amplifier is an instrument/interactive installation designed by Gareth Griffiths, Matthew Collings and Giorgos Aposkitis. The aim of the project was to create a means of amplifying the expressive qualities of guitar performance; yet removed from the expected guitar sounds. 

The signal from the guitar was analysed and used to trigger vibrating motors attached to a number of 'sounding objects' such a sheet metal, a metal lamp shade and a piano carcass, amongst other things. Careful mapping of the analysed data allowed the player to play the guitar, preserving the expressive intricacies of performance but also creating a wholly new sound world.

Transmission is a dance-tech work developed by choreographer Skye Reynolds. The work utilises Nintendo Wii controllers attached to dancers, sending gestural data used to compose sound and music in real-time. 

I was responsible for the overall of the software into the Max for Live environment and the creation of some of the sound design.

Here's Skye talking about the project.
